New service tracking option: copy_tasks_in_project

This option will create a common project for the Sale Order and assign to it all the tasks on the Template Project.

Creates a common project on the sale order if order lines has the service tracking field set to 'copy_tasks_in_project'.
This module avoids the creation of multiple projects when this case happens.
Once All tasks created from these lines will be assigned to this common project and only service tracking 'task_global_project' will create tasks in the informed project.
Created Projects and Tasks are created actived.
Orders creates a link on Projects which creates tasks inside it.


If module is informed on the sale order, all created tasks will be assigned to this project.
